<p><h1>Peripheral Artery Angioplasty Market: A Comprehensive Report of its Market Share & Growth Trends 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Peripheral Artery Angioplasty Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Peripheral Artery Angioplasty is a minimally invasive procedure used to widen and unblock narrowed or blocked arteries in the peripheral vascular system. This procedure involves inserting a catheter with a balloon at the tip into the affected artery and inflating the balloon to compress the plaque against the arterial wall, restoring blood flow. In some cases, a stent may also be placed to keep the artery open.</p><p>The Peripheral Artery Angioplasty Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.4% during the forecast period. The increasing prevalence of peripheral artery disease, along with advancements in technology, such as drug-coated balloons and bioresorbable stents, are driving market growth. Additionally, the rising geriatric population and lifestyle factors contributing to the development of peripheral artery disease are further propelling the demand for peripheral artery angioplasty procedures.</p><p>Moreover, the trend towards minimally invasive procedures and the development of new techniques for complex lesions are also contributing to the growth of the market. However, factors such as high procedure costs and limited reimbursement policies in some regions may hinder market growth to some extent. Overall, the Peripheral Artery Angioplasty Market is expected to witness significant growth opportunities in the coming years.</p></p>
