<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Optic Preform Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VAD</li><li>OVD</li><li>PCVD</li><li>MCVD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiber optic preform market consists of four main types: VAD (Vapor Axial Deposition), OVD (Outside Vapor Deposition), PCVD (Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition), and MCVD (Modified Chemical Vapor Deposition). VAD involves a heated rotating rod which pulls the fiber from a chemical vapor. OVD involves depositing layers of glass on a rotating rod. PCVD uses plasma to create the preform. MCVD involves blowing glass tubes and then collapsing them into preforms. Each method has its own advantages and applications in the fiber optic industry.</p></p>
