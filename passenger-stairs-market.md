<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenger Stairs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Propelled</li><li>Towable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Passenger stairs can be categorized into two main market types: self-propelled and towable. Self-propelled passenger stairs are equipped with their own power source and can move independently to the aircraft without needing to be towed. This type offers more flexibility and efficiency in terms of maneuverability. On the other hand, towable passenger stairs rely on being towed by a vehicle to transport passengers to and from the aircraft. This type is generally more cost-effective and easier to maintain compared to self-propelled stairs. Both types serve the same purpose of providing safe and convenient access for passengers boarding and disembarking from aircraft.</p></p>
