<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Core Reactors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Type</li><li>Oil Immersed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air core reactors are popular in two main types: Dry Type and Oil Immersed Type. Dry Type air core reactors are filled with air and are more suitable for indoor applications as they do not require oil cooling. On the other hand, Oil Immersed Type air core reactors are filled with insulating oil to improve cooling efficiency and are suitable for outdoor applications. Both types play a crucial role in power systems for power factor correction, voltage regulation, and grid stability.</p></p>
