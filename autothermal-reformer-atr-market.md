<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Autothermal Reformer (ATR) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-desulfurization</li><li>Desulfurization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Autothermal Reformer (ATR) is a technology used in the production of syngas, a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, from natural gas. There are two main types of ATR markets based on the treatment of sulfur compounds: non-desulfurization and desulfurization. In the non-desulfurization market, ATR systems do not remove sulfur compounds from the natural gas feed, while in the desulfurization market, ATR systems are equipped with desulfurization units to remove sulfur before reforming the gas. Both markets cater to different industries and applications based on their specific requirements.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Autothermal Reformer (ATR) Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-reformed Gas</li><li>Refinery Off Gas</li><li>Natural Gas</li><li>Fischer-Tropsch tail-Gas</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Autothermal Reformers (ATR) are used in various industries such as pre-reformed gas, refinery off gas, natural gas, and Fischer-Tropsch tail gas applications. Pre-reformed gas is a feedstock that has already undergone partial reforming, making it easier for ATR to further convert it into syngas. Refinery off gas, natural gas, and Fischer-Tropsch tail gas are also commonly used as feedstocks for ATR, allowing for efficient production of syngas for various industrial processes.</p></p>
