<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Bearings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolling Bearing</li><li>Plain Bearing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Carbon Bearings market includes two main types: Rolling Bearings and Plain Bearings. Rolling Bearings are designed with rolling elements, such as balls or rollers, which reduce friction between moving parts. These bearings are commonly used in applications requiring high speeds and precision. Plain Bearings, on the other hand, have a sliding surface, which provides support and reduces friction through sliding motion. They are often used in applications where heavy loads and low speeds are common. Both types of bearings play crucial roles in various industrial and mechanical applications.</p></p>
