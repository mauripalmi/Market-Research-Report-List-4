<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Ventilation Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dilution Ventilation</li><li>Local Exhaust Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial ventilation systems are crucial for maintaining safe and healthy working environments in industrial settings. Dilution ventilation systems work by diluting contaminated air with clean air to reduce the concentration of pollutants in the overall workspace. In contrast, local exhaust ventilation systems capture and remove contaminants at the source before they can disperse into the surrounding air. Both types of ventilation systems play a vital role in ensuring proper air quality and worker safety in various industrial applications.</p></p>
