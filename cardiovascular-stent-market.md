<p><h1>Cardiovascular Stent Market Size, Market Share and Global Market Analysis Report, 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Cardiovascular Stent Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>A cardiovascular stent is a tiny, metallic mesh tube that is inserted in a blood vessel to keep it open and facilitate blood flow to the heart. These stents are commonly used in the treatment of coronary artery diseases, such as heart attacks and chest pain.</p><p>The global cardiovascular stent market is witnessing significant growth, driven by the rising prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, increasing geriatric population, and technological advancements in stent design. The market is also being propelled by the growing demand for minimally invasive procedures and the expanding healthcare infrastructure in developing countries.</p><p>The cardiovascular stent market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% during the forecast period. One of the latest trends in the market is the development of bioresorbable stents, which are designed to dissolve over time and reduce the risk of long-term complications associated with traditional metal stents. Other ongoing trends include the adoption of drug-eluting stents, which release medication to prevent the buildup of scar tissue and reduce the risk of restenosis. These advancements are expected to drive further growth in the cardiovascular stent market in the coming years.</p></p>
