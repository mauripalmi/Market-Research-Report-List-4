<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Double Flap Isolation Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lifting</li><li>Rotary Opening</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Double flap isolation valves are commonly available in two types: lifting and rotary opening. In lifting type valves, the two flaps move upwards to open the valve, allowing fluid flow. On the other hand, in rotary opening type valves, the two flaps rotate to open the valve. Both types provide effective blocking of fluid flow, preventing leaks and ensuring reliable isolation. Customers can choose between lifting and rotary opening valves based on their specific needs and preferences.</p></p>
