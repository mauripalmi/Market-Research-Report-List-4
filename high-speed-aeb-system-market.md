<p><strong>The High Speed AEB System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Forward Collision Warning</li><li>Dynamic Brake Support</li><li>Crash Imminent Braking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High Speed AEB Systems are advanced safety technologies that help prevent or reduce the severity of collisions in high-speed driving scenarios. The Forward Collision Warning system alerts drivers of an imminent collision, while Dynamic Brake Support automatically increases braking force to help avoid a crash. Crash Imminent Braking takes these warnings a step further by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver does not respond in time. These technologies work together to enhance driver safety and reduce the risk of high-speed collisions.</p></p>
