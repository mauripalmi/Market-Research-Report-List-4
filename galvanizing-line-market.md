<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Galvanizing Line Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot-Dip Galvanizing Line</li><li>Electrolytic Galvanizing Line</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Galvanizing lines are used for applying a protective zinc coating to steel products. Two common types are hot-dip galvanizing lines and electrolytic galvanizing lines. Hot-dip galvanizing involves dipping the steel into molten zinc, while electrolytic galvanizing uses an electric current to deposit zinc onto the steel surface. Both processes provide corrosion protection and enhance the durability of the steel products. The choice between the two types depends on factors such as the required coating thickness, surface finish, and production volume.</p></p>
