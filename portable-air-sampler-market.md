<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Air Sampler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Type</li><li>Passive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Portable air samplers are divided into two main types: Active and Passive. Active samplers use a pump to actively draw in air, capturing particles onto a filter or other collection media. This type is commonly used for environments where specific pollutants need to be monitored continuously. Passive samplers, on the other hand, operate without a pump and rely on diffusion to collect particles. Passive samplers are ideal for long-term monitoring but may not provide real-time results. Both types play important roles in monitoring air quality and ensuring a safe environment.</p></p>
