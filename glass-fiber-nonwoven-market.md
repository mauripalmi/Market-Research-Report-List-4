<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glass FIber Nonwoven Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet-Laid Process</li><li>Dry-Laid Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Glass fiber nonwoven market types include wet-laid process and dry-laid process. In the wet-laid process, glass fibers are dispersed in water and then laid down on a moving belt to form a mat which is then dried. This method offers better uniformity and higher strength in the final product. On the other hand, the dry-laid process involves directly laying down dry fibers onto a conveyor belt and then bonding them together using heat or chemicals. This method is quicker and more cost-effective but may result in lower strength and uniformity.</p></p>
