<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Poultry Isolator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Isolator</li><li>Negative Pressure Isolator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Poultry isolators are specialized enclosures used to maintain a controlled environment for poultry research and production. Positive pressure isolators are designed to keep contaminants out by maintaining a higher pressure inside compared to outside, while negative pressure isolators remove contaminants by keeping a lower pressure inside. Positive pressure isolators are ideal for protecting valuable research subjects from external pathogens, while negative pressure isolators are used for containing infectious agents to prevent their spread. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring biosecurity and research integrity in the poultry industry.</p></p>
